# Tech Questions

## Please answer the following questions in a markdown file calledÂ Answers to technical questions.md.
## 1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn&#39;t spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

   It took me approximately an hour. I would add results counts, images, debounces and error messages if api is not available.

## 2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you&#39;ve used it.
   
    The project did not need more than basic es6. Simple is always better.

## 3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
      
     We use sentry to get notification of errors in the applications.

## 4. How would you improve the API that you just used?

     It worked for this demo. In production, more details is necessary.  A filter feature is a must.

## 5. Please describe yourself using JSON.
    
    {
       "name": "Ronaldo Magrare",
       "likes": ["apples","beach","animals"],
       "version": 1.0.0
    }
